ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VijayanagaramRahul and I am pursuing my graduation in the stream of computer science & engineering, In the first semester of my graduation, I have learned programming by using C which made me think about web development or web technologies. so, I have learned HTML, CSS, MySQL, and PHP. As a part of it, I have developed 11 projects among them 2 are e-commerce platforms and 3 are hybrid apps, and the remaining are websites of different types like education, blogging.

This fabulous journey will help me to find my passion i.e.,  I am passionate about building software products.
